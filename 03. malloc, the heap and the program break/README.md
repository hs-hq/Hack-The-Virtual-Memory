# Hack The Virtual Memory, chapter 3: malloc, the heap and the program break

This is the fourth chapter in a series around virtual memory. The goal of this series is to learn some CS basics, but in a different and more practical way.

If you missed the previous chapters, you should probably start there:

- Chapter 0: [Hack The Virtual Memory: C strings & /proc](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-c-strings-proc/)
- Chapter 1: [Hack The Virtual Memory: Python bytes](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-python-bytes/)
- Chapter 2: [Hack The Virtual Memory: Drawing the VM diagram](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-drawing-the-vm-diagram/)

## The heap

In this chapter we will look at the heap and `malloc` in order to answer some of the questions we ended with at the end of the [previous chapter](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-drawing-the-vm-diagram/):

- Why doesn't our allocated memory start at the very beginning of the heap (0x2050010 vs 02050000)? What are those first 16 bytes used for?
- Is the heap actually growing upwards?

## Prerequisites

In order to fully understand this article, you will need to know:

- The basics of the C programming language (especially pointers)
- The very basics of the Linux filesystem and the shell
- We will also use the `/proc/[pid]/maps` file (see `man proc` or read our first article [Hack The Virtual Memory, chapter 0: C strings & /proc](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-c-strings-proc/))

## Environment

All scripts and programs have been tested on the following system:

- Ubuntu
  - Linux ubuntu 4.4.0-31-generic #50~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 01:07:32 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Tools used:
  
- gcc
  - gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3) 4.8.4
- glibc 2.19 (see [version.c](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Hack-The-Virtual-Memory/blob/master/03.%20malloc%2C%20the%20heap%20and%20the%20program%20break/version.c) if you need to check your glibc version)
- strace
  - strace -- version 4.8

**Everything we will write will be true for this system/environment, but may be different on another system**

We will also go through the Linux source code. If you are on Ubuntu, you can download the sources of your current kernel by running this command:

```
apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)
```

## `malloc`

`malloc` is the common function used to dynamically allocate memory. This memory is allocated on the "heap".
_Note: `malloc` is not a system call._

From `man malloc`:

```
[...] allocate dynamic memory[...]
void *malloc(size_t size);
[...]
The malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
```

### No malloc, no [heap]

Let's look at memory regions of a process that does not call `malloc` (`0-main.c`).

```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - do nothing
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

```

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 0-main.c -o 0
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ ./0 

```

_Quick reminder (1/3): the memory regions of a process are listed in the `/proc/[pid]/maps` file. As a result, we first need to know the PID of the process. That is done using the `ps` command; the second column of `ps aux` output will give us the PID of the process. Please read [chapter 0](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-c-strings-proc/) to learn more._

```
julien@holberton:/tmp$ ps aux | grep \ \./0$
julien     3638  0.0  0.0   4200   648 pts/9    S+   12:01   0:00 ./0
```

_Quick reminder (2/3): from the above output, we can see that the PID of the process we want to look at is `3638`. As a result, the `maps` file will be found in the directory `/proc/3638`._

```
julien@holberton:/tmp$ cd /proc/3638
```

_Quick reminder (3/3): The `maps` file contains the memory regions of the process. The format of each line in this file is:
address           perms offset  dev   inode       pathname_

```

_Note: `hackthevm3` is a symbolic link to `hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/`_

-> As we can see from the above maps file, there’s no [heap] region allocated.

### `malloc(x)`

Let's do the same but with a program that calls `malloc` (`1-main.c`):

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/**
 * main - 1 call to malloc
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	malloc(1);
	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 1-main.c -o 1
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ ./1 

```

```
julien@holberton:/proc/3638$ ps aux | grep \ \./1$
julien     3718  0.0  0.0   4332   660 pts/9    S+   12:09   0:00 ./1
julien@holberton:/proc/3638$ cd /proc/3718
julien@holberton:/proc/3718$ cat maps 
00400000-00401000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 176964                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/1
00600000-00601000 r--p 00000000 08:01 176964                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/1
00601000-00602000 rw-p 00001000 08:01 176964                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/1
01195000-011b6000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]
...
julien@holberton:/proc/3718$ 
```

-> the [heap] is here.

Let's check the return value of `malloc` to make sure the returned address is in the heap region (`2-main.c`):

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/**
 * main - prints the malloc returned address
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	void *p;

	p = malloc(1);
	printf("%p\n", p);
	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 2-main.c -o 2
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ ./2 
0x24d6010

```

```
julien@holberton:/proc/3718$ ps aux | grep \ \./2$
julien     3834  0.0  0.0   4336   676 pts/9    S+   12:48   0:00 ./2
julien@holberton:/proc/3718$ cd /proc/3834
julien@holberton:/proc/3834$ cat maps
00400000-00401000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 176966                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/2
00600000-00601000 r--p 00000000 08:01 176966                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/2
00601000-00602000 rw-p 00001000 08:01 176966                             /home/julien/holberton/w/hack_the_virtual_memory/03. The Heap/2
024d6000-024f7000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]
...
julien@holberton:/proc/3834$ 
```

-> `024d6000` <`0x24d6010` < `024f7000`

The returned address is inside the heap region. And as we have seen in the [previous chapter](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-drawing-the-vm-diagram/), the returned address does not start exactly at the beginning of the region; we'll see why later.

## `strace`, `brk` and `sbrk`

`malloc` is a "regular" function (as opposed to a system call), so it must call some kind of syscall in order to manipulate the heap. Let's use `strace` to find out.

`strace` is a program used to trace system calls and signals. Any program will always use a few syscalls before your `main` function is executed. In order to know which syscalls are used by `malloc`, we will add a `write` syscall before and after the call to `malloc`(`3-main.c`).

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - let's find out which syscall malloc is using
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	void *p;

	write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC\n", 14);
	p = malloc(1);
	write(1, "AFTER MALLOC\n", 13);
	printf("%p\n", p);
	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 3-main.c -o 3
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ strace ./3 
execve("./3", ["./3"], [/* 61 vars */]) = 0
...
write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC\n", 14BEFORE MALLOC
)         = 14
brk(0)                                  = 0xe70000
brk(0xe91000)                           = 0xe91000
write(1, "AFTER MALLOC\n", 13AFTER MALLOC
)          = 13
...
read(0, 
```

From the above listing we can focus on this:

```
brk(0)                                  = 0xe70000
brk(0xe91000)                           = 0xe91000
```

-> `malloc` is using the `brk` system call in order to manipulate the heap. From `brk` man page (`man brk`), we can see what this system call is doing:

```
...
       int brk(void *addr);
       void *sbrk(intptr_t increment);
...
DESCRIPTION
       brk() and sbrk() change the location of the program  break,  which  defines
       the end of the process's data segment (i.e., the program break is the first
       location after the end of the uninitialized data segment).  Increasing  the
       program  break has the effect of allocating memory to the process; decreas‐
       ing the break deallocates memory.

       brk() sets the end of the data segment to the value specified by addr, when
       that  value  is  reasonable,  the system has enough memory, and the process
       does not exceed its maximum data size (see setrlimit(2)).

       sbrk() increments the program's data space  by  increment  bytes.   Calling
       sbrk()  with  an increment of 0 can be used to find the current location of
       the program break.
```

The program break is the address of the first location beyond the current end of the data region of the program in the virual memory.

![program break before the call to malloc / brk](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool/medias/program-break-before.png)

By increasing the value of the program break, via `brk` or `sbrk`, the function `malloc` creates a new space that can then be used by the process to dynamically allocate memory (using `malloc`).

![program break after the malloc / brk call](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool/medias/program-break-after.png)

So the heap is actually an extension of the data segment of the program.

The first call to `brk` (`brk(0)`) returns the current address of the program break to `malloc`. And the second call is the one that actually creates new memory (since `0xe91000` > `0xe70000`) by increasing the value of the program break. In the above example, the heap is now starting at `0xe70000` and ends at `0xe91000`. Let's double check with the `/proc/[PID]/maps` file:

```

...
julien@holberton:/proc/4014$ 
```

-> `00e70000-00e91000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]` matches the pointers returned back to `malloc` by `brk`.

That's great, but wait, why did`malloc` increment the heap by `00e91000` - `00e70000` = `0x21000` or `135168` bytes, when we only asked for only 1 byte?

## Many mallocs

What will happen if we call `malloc` several times? (`4-main.c`)

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - many calls to malloc
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	void *p;

	write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC #0\n", 17);
	p = malloc(1024);
	write(1, "AFTER MALLOC #0\n", 16);
	printf("%p\n", p);

	write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC #1\n", 17);
	p = malloc(1024);
	write(1, "AFTER MALLOC #1\n", 16);
	printf("%p\n", p);

	write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC #2\n", 17);
	p = malloc(1024);
	write(1, "AFTER MALLOC #2\n", 16);
	printf("%p\n", p);

	write(1, "BEFORE MALLOC #3\n", 17);
	p = malloc(1024);
	write(1, "AFTER MALLOC #3\n", 16);
	printf("%p\n", p);

	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

```

-> `malloc` is NOT calling `brk` each time we call it.

The first time, `malloc` creates a new space (the heap) for the program (by increasing the program break location). The following times, `malloc` uses the same space to give our program "new" chunks of memory. Those "new" chunks of memory are part of the memory previously allocated using `brk`. This way, `malloc` doesn't have to use syscalls (`brk`) every time we call it, and thus it makes `malloc` - and our programs using `malloc` - faster. It also allows `malloc` and `free` to optimize the usage of the memory.

Let's double check that we have only one heap, allocated by the first call to `brk`:

-> We have only one [heap] and the addresses match those returned by `sbrk`: `0x1314000` & `0x1335000`

## Naive malloc

Based on the above, and assuming we won't ever need to free anything, we can now write our own (naive) version of `malloc`, that would move the program break each time it is called.

```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**                                                                                            
 * malloc - naive version of malloc: dynamically allocates memory on the heap using sbrk                         
 * @size: number of bytes to allocate                                                          
 *                                                                                             
 * Return: the memory address newly allocated, or NULL on error                                
 *                                                                                             
 * Note: don't do this at home :)                                                              
 */
void *malloc(size_t size)
{
	void *previous_break;

	previous_break = sbrk(size);
	/* check for error */
	if (previous_break == (void *) -1)
	{
		/* on error malloc returns NULL */
		return (NULL);
	}
	return (previous_break);
}
```

## The 0x10 lost bytes

If we look at the output of the previous program (`4-main.c`), we can see that the first memory address returned by `malloc` doesn't start at the beginning of the heap, but `0x10` bytes after: `0x1314010` vs `0x1314000`. Also, when we call `malloc(1024)` a second time, the address should be `0x1314010` (the returned value of the first call to `malloc`) + `1024` (or `0x400` in hexadecimal, since the first call to `malloc` was asking for `1024` bytes) = `0x1318010`. But the return value of the second call to `malloc` is `0x1314420`. We have lost `0x10` bytes again! Same goes for the subsequent calls.

Let's look at what we can find inside those "lost" `0x10`-byte memory spaces (`5-main.c`) and whether the memory loss stays constant:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**                                                                                            
 * pmem - print mem                                                                            
 * @p: memory address to start printing from                                                   
 * @bytes: number of bytes to print                                                            
 *                                                                                             
 * Return: nothing                                                                             
 */

	ptr = (unsigned char *)p;
	for (i = 0; i < bytes; i++)
	{
		if (i != 0)
		{
			printf(" ");
		}
		printf("%02x", *(ptr + i));
	}
	printf("\n");
}

```

There is one clear pattern: the size of the malloc'ed memory chunk is always found in the preceding 0x10 bytes. For instance, the first `malloc` call is malloc'ing `1024` (`0x0400`) bytes and we can find `11 04 00 00 00 00 00 00` in the preceding `0x10` bytes. Those last bytes represent the number `0x 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 11` = `0x400` (1024) + `0x10` (the block size preceding those `1024` bytes + `1` (we'll talk about this "+1" later in this chapter). If we look at each `0x10` bytes preceding the addresses returned by `malloc`, they all contain the size of the chunk of memory asked to `malloc` + `0x10` + `1`.

At this point, given what we said and saw earlier, we can probably guess that those 0x10 bytes are a sort of data structure used by `malloc` (and `free`) to deal with the heap. And indeed, even though we don't understand everything yet, we can already use this data structure to go from one malloc'ed chunk of memory to the other (`6-main.c`) as long as we have the address of the beginning of the heap (_and as long as we have never called `free`_):

One of our open questions from the previous chapter is now answered: `malloc` is using `0x10` additional bytes for each malloc'ed memory block to store the size of the block.

![0x10 bytes preceeding malloc](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool/medias/0x10-malloc.png)

This data will actually be used by `free` to save it to a list of available blocks for future calls to `malloc`.

But our study also raises a new question: what are the first 8 bytes of the 16 (`0x10` in hexadecimal) bytes used for? It seems to always be zero. Is it just padding?

### RTFSC

At this stage, we probably want to check the source code of `malloc` to confirm what we just found (`malloc.c` from the glibc).

```
1055 /*
1056	   malloc_chunk details:
1057	
1058	    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)
1059	
1060	    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
1061	    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
1062	    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
1063	    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
1064	    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
1065	    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
1066	    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
1067	    in use.
1068	
1069	    An allocated chunk looks like this:
1070	
1071	
1072	    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1073	            |             Size of previous chunk, if unallocated (P clear)  |
1074	            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1075	            |             Size of chunk, in bytes                     |A|M|P|
1076	      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1077	            |             User data starts here...                          .
1078	            .                                                               .
1079	            .             (malloc_usable_size() bytes)                      .
1080	            .                                                               |
1081	nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1082	            |             (size of chunk, but used for application data)    |
1083	            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1084	            |             Size of next chunk, in bytes                |A|0|1|
1085	            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1086	
1087	    Where "chunk" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
1088	    the malloc code, but "mem" is the pointer that is returned to the
1089	    user.  "Nextchunk" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.
```

-> We were correct \o/. Right before the address returned by `malloc` to the user, we have two variables:

- Size of previous chunk, if unallocated: we never free'd any chunks so that is why it was always 0
- Size of chunk, in bytes

Let's free some chunks to confirm that the first 8 bytes are used the way the source code describes it (`7-main.c`):

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

As we can see from the above listing, when the previous chunk has been free'd, the malloc chunk's first 8 bytes contain the size of the previous unallocated chunk. So the correct representation of a malloc chunk is the following:

![malloc chunk](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool/medias/malloc-chunk.png)

Also, it seems that the first bit of the next 8 bytes (containing the size of the current chunk) serves as a flag to check if the previous chunk is used (`1`) or not (`0`). So the correct updated version of our program should be written this way (`8-main.c`):

## Is the heap actually growing upwards?

The last question left unanswered is: "Is the heap actually growing upwards?". From the `brk` man page, it seems so:

```
DESCRIPTION
       brk() and sbrk() change the location of the program break, which defines the end  of  the
       process's  data  segment  (i.e., the program break is the first location after the end of
       the uninitialized data segment).  Increasing the program break has the effect of allocat‐
       ing memory to the process; decreasing the break deallocates memory.
```

Let's check! (`9-main.c`)

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - moving the program break
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	int i;

	write(1, "START\n", 6);
	malloc(1);
	getchar();
	write(1, "LOOP\n", 5);
	for (i = 0; i < 0x25000 / 1024; i++)
	{
		malloc(1024);
	}
	write(1, "END\n", 4);
	getchar();
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

Now let’s confirm this assumption with strace:

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ strace ./9 
execve("./9", ["./9"], [/* 61 vars */]) = 0
...
write(1, "START\n", 6START
)                  = 6
brk(0)                                  = 0x1fd8000
brk(0x1ff9000)                          = 0x1ff9000
...
write(1, "LOOP\n", 5LOOP
)                   = 5
brk(0x201a000)                          = 0x201a000
write(1, "END\n", 4END
)                    = 4
...
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ 
```

clearly, `malloc` made only two calls to `brk` to increase the allocated space on the heap. And the second call is using a higher memory address argument (`0x201a000` > `0x1ff9000`). The second syscall was triggered when the space on the heap was too small to host all the malloc calls.

Let's double check with `/proc`.

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 9-main.c -o 9
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ ./9
START

```

```
julien@holberton:/proc/7855$ ps aux | grep \ \./9$
julien     7972  0.0  0.0   4332   684 pts/9    S+   19:08   0:00 ./9
julien@holberton:/proc/7855$ cd /proc/7972
julien@holberton:/proc/7972$ cat maps
...
00901000-00922000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]
...
julien@holberton:/proc/7972$ 
```

-> `00901000-00922000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]`
Let's hit Enter and look at the [heap] again:

```
LOOP
END

```

```
julien@holberton:/proc/7972$ cat maps
...
00901000-00943000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]
...
julien@holberton:/proc/7972$ 
```

-> `00901000-00943000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap]`
The beginning of the heap is still the same, but the size has increased upwards from `00922000` to `00943000`.

## The Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR)

You may have noticed something "strange" in the `/proc/pid/maps` listing above, that we want to study:

The program break is the address of the first location beyond the current end of the data region - so the address of the first location beyond the executable in the virtual memory. As a consequence, the heap should start right after the end of the executable in memory. As you can see in all above listing, it is NOT the case. The only thing that is true is that the heap is always the next memory region after the executable, which makes sense since the heap is actually part of the data segment of the executable itself. Also, if we look even closer, the memory gap size between the executable and the heap is never the same:

_Format of the following lines: [PID of the above `maps` listings]: address of the beginning of the [heap] - address of the end of the executable = memory gap size_

- [3718]: 01195000 - 00602000 = b93000
- [3834]: 024d6000 - 00602000 = 1ed4000
- [4014]: 00e70000 - 00602000 = 86e000
- [4172]: 01314000 - 00602000 = d12000
- [7972]: 00901000 - 00602000 = 2ff000

It seems that this gap size is random, and indeed, it is. If we look at the ELF binary loader source code (`fs/binfmt_elf.c`) we can find this:

```C
        if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) && (randomize_va_space > 1)) {
                current->mm->brk = current->mm->start_brk =
                        arch_randomize_brk(current->mm);
#ifdef compat_brk_randomized
                current->brk_randomized = 1;
#endif
        }
```

where `current->mm->brk` is the address of the program break. The `arch_randomize_brk` function can be found in the `arch/x86/kernel/process.c` file:

```C
unsigned long arch_randomize_brk(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
        unsigned long range_end = mm->brk + 0x02000000;
        return randomize_range(mm->brk, range_end, 0) ? : mm->brk;
}
```

The `randomize_range` returns a start address such that:

```C
    [...... <range> .....]
  start                  end
```

Source code of the `randomize_range` function (`drivers/char/random.c`):

```C
/*
 * randomize_range() returns a start address such that
 *
 *    [...... <range> .....]
 *  start                  end
 *
 * a <range> with size "len" starting at the return value is inside in the
 * area defined by [start, end], but is otherwise randomized.
 */
unsigned long
randomize_range(unsigned long start, unsigned long end, unsigned long len)
{
        unsigned long range = end - len - start;

        if (end <= start + len)
                return 0;
        return PAGE_ALIGN(get_random_int() % range + start);
}
```

As a result, the offset between the data section of the executable and the program break initial position when the process runs can have a size of anywhere between `0` and `0x02000000`. This randomization is known as Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR). ASLR is a computer security technique involved in preventing exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. In order to prevent an attacker from jumping to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the positions of the heap and the stack.

## The updated VM diagram

/**

 */
void pmem(void *p, unsigned int bytes)
{
	unsigned char *ptr;
	unsigned int i;

	ptr = (unsigned char *)p;
	for (i = 0; i < bytes; i++)
	{
		if (i != 0)
		{
			printf(" ");
		}
		printf("%02x", *(ptr + i));
	}
	printf("\n");
}

/**
 * main - moving the program break
 *
 * Return: EXIT_FAILURE if something failed. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
	void *p;
	size_t size_of_the_chunk;
	char prev_used;

	p = malloc(0);
	printf("%p\n", p);
	pmem((char *)p - 0x10, 0x10);
	size_of_the_chunk = *((size_t *)((char *)p - 8));
	prev_used = size_of_the_chunk & 1;
	size_of_the_chunk -= prev_used;
	printf("chunk size = %li bytes\n", size_of_the_chunk);
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

```
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror 10-main.c -o 10
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ ./10
0xd08010
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
chunk size = 32 bytes
julien@holberton:~/holberton/w/hackthevm3$ 
```

-> `malloc(0)` is actually using 32 bytes, including the first `0x10` bytes.

Again, note that this will not always be the case. From the man page (`man malloc`):

```
NULL may also be returned by a successful call to malloc() with a size of zero

We have learned a couple of things about malloc and the heap. But there is actually more than `brk` and `sbrk`. You can try malloc'ing a big chunk of memory, `strace` it, and look at `/proc` to learn more before we cover it in a next chapter :)

Also, studying how `free` works in coordination with `malloc` is something we haven't covered yet. If you want to look at it, you will find part of the answer to why the minimum chunk size is `32` (when we ask `malloc` for `0` bytes) vs `16` (`0x10` in hexadecimal) or `0`.

As usual, to be continued! Let me know if you have something you would like me to cover in the next chapter.
