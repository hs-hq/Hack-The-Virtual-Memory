This is a series of small articles / tutorials based around virtual memory. The goal is to learn some CS basics, but in a different and more practical way.

## TOC

### 00. C strings & `/proc`

For this first piece, we'll use `/proc` to find and modify variables (in this example, an ASCII string) contained inside the virtual memory of a running process, and learn some cool things along the way.

### 01. Python bytes

For this second piece, we'll do almost the same thing, but instead we will access the virtual memory of a running Python 3 script. It is not as straightfoward. Let's take this as an excuse to look at some Python 3 internals!
